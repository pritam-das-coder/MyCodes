# 🚀 Daily Coding Log & Practice

Welcome to my daily coding repository! This space serves as a continuous tracker of my coding journey, where I upload the code I write every day to improve my problem-solving skills, master core computer science concepts, and build a consistent development habit.

## 👨‍💻 About Me

I am a B.Tech Computer Science and Engineering student at Kalyani Government Engineering College. I am passionate about writing clean, efficient code and building a strong foundation in software development. 

I created this repository to hold myself accountable, track my daily progress, and provide transparency to recruiters and peers regarding my dedication to continuous learning.

## 🛠️ Languages & Focus Areas

This repository primarily contains code written in the following languages:

* **C / C++:** My core focus for mastering Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA), memory management, and Object-Oriented Programming (OOP).
* **Python:** Used for rapid prototyping, logic building, exploring data science concepts, and building mini-projects (like GUI applications).

## 📂 Repository Structure

The code is organized logically by language and concept to make it easy to navigate. Here is a general breakdown of how the files are structured:

* `/C` - Fundamental programming concepts and logic building.
* `/CPP` - Object-Oriented Programming, STL practice, and competitive programming solutions.
* `/Python` - Scripts, mini-projects, and algorithmic problem-solving.
* `/DSA` - Dedicated folder for Data Structures and Algorithms implementations across languages.

## 🎯 Goals

Through this daily practice, I aim to:
1.  Solve complex algorithmic problems efficiently.
2.  Maintain a streak of daily commits to build discipline.
3.  Write highly readable, well-commented, and optimized code.
4.  Deepen my understanding of computer architecture and computational logic.

## ⚙️ How to Run the Code

Most of the files in this repository are standalone scripts. You can clone this repository and run the files using your local compilers or interpreters.

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/pritam-das-coder/MyCodes.git
```
* For C/C++: Use gcc or g++ to compile and run the .c or .cpp files.

* For Python: Run the .py files using python3 filename.py.
